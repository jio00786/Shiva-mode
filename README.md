## ðŸŒŸ Description
Interface Description â€“ Shiva Mode: UX/UI as Cosmic Offering  
A sacred tool forged at the confluence of silence and design. Shiva Mode invites the seeker to step beyond distractionâ€”into a space where discipline becomes devotion, and interaction becomes invocation.

Every feature here is not just utilityâ€”it is a yantra, a mirror, a ritual. Together, they form a digital altar aligned with the 27 lights of the Nakshatra sky.

ðŸ”¹ Timer â€“ "Discipline as Devotion"  
Marks time not as a race, but as a rhythm. A tap to begin. A silence to follow. Each second, a bell echoing Shivaâ€™s breath between creation and stillness.

ðŸ”¹ Reflection Box â€“ "Witness Within"  
A blank canvas for the unseen. Here, one writes not to shareâ€”but to see. The ink holds space for truth as it arises, wordless or raw.

ðŸ”¹ Screen Capture â€“ "Sacred Memory"  
This is not vanity. This is veneration. Capture states of grace, stillness, or surrenderâ€”for the archive of Self returning to Source.

ðŸ”¹ Shiva Mode Toggle â€“ "Crossing the Veil"  
A single switch transforms perception. Color fades, noise quiets. Shiva Mode initiates the shiftâ€”from task to tapas, from surface to soul.
